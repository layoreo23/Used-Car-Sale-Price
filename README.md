# Used-Car-Sale-Price
A machine learning model built using a Random Forest Regressor to predict the sale prices of used cars based on years used, transmission type, fuel type, etc.

The model is trained on a dataset comprising various features such as mileage, year, transmission type, and number of past owners. Through this project, we aim to provide a reliable tool for estimating car sale prices based on key attributes, aiding both buyers and sellers in the automotive market.
